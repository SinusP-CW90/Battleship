# Battleship [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SinusP-CW90/Battleship.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/SinusP-CW90/Battleship) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/SinusP-CW90/Battleship/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/SinusP-CW90/Battleship?branch=main)
As a software project of the course Software Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences 
HTWG Konstanz, I'm developing the everywhere popular game 'Battleship'. 

I'm willing to give each feature as far as possible a branch, hence the README.md of each 
branch will tell you something about the feature. The branch 'developer' is the point where I merge the features.
