# Battleship
As a software project of the course Software Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences HTWG Konstanz we (Christopher and Orkan) are developing the everywhere popular game 'Battleship'. 
We are willing to give each feature as far as possible a branch, hence the README.md of each branch will tell you something about the feature. The branch 'developer' is the point where we merge the features.
